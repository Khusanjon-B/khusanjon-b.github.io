The goal was to create a compact and responsive display that continuously shows the current date, time, temperature, humidity, and volume level (via potentiometer). The idea came from my interest in combining sensors with dynamic visual feedbackâ€”and I built the system from scratch, iterating on both hardware layout and software logic.",

The model is trained using PyTorch, achieving high accuracy in digit classification. Another aspect of the project is the pygame interface, which allows users to draw digits and see predictions in real-time. There is also a feature that allows the user to train the model with their own handwritten digits.",
